# Indent Selection Extension

A simple VS Code extension that adds a context menu option to indent the selected code as a block.

## Features

- Right-click on a selection of code and choose "Indent Selection as Block" to indent all selected lines at once
- Right-click on a selection of code and choose "Outdent Selection as Block" to remove one level of indentation from all selected lines
- Intelligently handles both spaces and tabs based on your VS Code settings
- Outdent feature preserves non-indented lines (only removes indentation if it exists)
